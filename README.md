- **State Management**: Implementing a centralized state system instead of scattered global variables
- **TypeScript Setup**: Using TypeScript from the start for better error catching and code maintainability

### What would be added with more time?

#### Immediate Improvements

- **Real Encryption**: Replace Base64 with proper AES encryption for localStorage
- **Export/Import**: PDF export functionality

#### Long-term Features

- **Backend Integration**: RESTful API with database persistence
- **Enhanced Code Support**: Multiple code blocks per note with execution environment
